    <p>For our first project in advanced engineering the students who were adept in Fusion 360 we tasked with follwing several designs that assembled into a mini train car. One of the hardest parts of this task for me was the assembly step, as I had never used assembly in Fusion 360 before this project. I found it to be challenging and very fun to test my 3D modeling skills! </Adv>

    <h2>Kidwind Worlds</h2>
    <p><a href="https://kidwind.org/worlds/2025/">Info website!</a></p>
    <p>During this project we were tasked to create a wind turbine that would be efficient, powerful, and resistant to stress. We then competed against other teams from all over the world to see who had the best design. My team and I won the Rookie of the Year Award for our design which very pleasing to me and my team. Our winning design was a 3 bladed wind turbine with a 12.5 degree angle of attack, using mostly 3D printed and machined parts.
